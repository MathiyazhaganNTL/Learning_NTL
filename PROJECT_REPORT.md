## 3. Authentication System

### 3.1 Authentication Provider
The application uses **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management.

### 3.2 Types of Login

| Login Type | Description | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **Email + Password Login** | Traditional email/password authentication | Users enter email and password; Firebase validates credentials via `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` |
| **Email + Password Registration** | New account creation | Users provide name, email, password, and select a role; Firebase creates the account via `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` |
| **Role-Based Login** | Users select their role before logging in | A visual **Role Selector** component lets users choose: Learner, Instructor, or Admin before signing in |

### 3.3 User Roles

| Role | Icon | Access Level | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Learner** 🎓 | GraduationCap | Standard | Access courses, track progress, earn badges, take quizzes |
| **Instructor** 📽️ | Projector | Elevated | Create/edit courses, manage students, view reports |
| **Admin** 🛡️ | ShieldCheck | Full | System configuration, user management, complete oversight |
| **Guest** | — | Read-only | Browse courses catalog (no enrollment) |

### 3.4 Authentication Flow

```
User Opens App
    ↓
AuthContext checks Firebase auth state (onAuthStateChanged)
    ↓
If Authenticated → Redirect to Dashboard / My Courses
If Not Authenticated → Show Login Page
    ↓
User selects Role → Enters Email + Password → Submits
    ↓
Firebase validates → Auth State updates → User enters app
    ↓
Protected Routes check role → Grant/Deny access
```

### 3.5 Route Protection
- **ProtectedRoute**: Requires authentication; optionally checks user role
- **AuthRoute**: Redirects already-logged-in users away from login/register pages
- **Role-Based Guards**: Backoffice routes require `admin` or `instructor` roles

| **Firebase Auth** | Secure authentication with Firebase's built-in security |
| **Route Guards** | Protected routes with role-based access control |
| **CORS Handling** | Vite proxy for secure API communication in development |
| **Input Validation** | Zod schema validation on forms |
